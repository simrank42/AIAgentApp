# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security features, best practices, and vulnerability reporting process for the AI Chat Backend application.

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Tokens**: Secure JWT-based authentication with access and refresh tokens
- **Token Rotation**: Refresh tokens are rotated on each use for enhanced security
- **Token Revocation**: Tokens can be revoked and blacklisted
- **Password Security**: Argon2 password hashing with strong parameters
- **CAPTCHA Protection**: Required for all login attempts to prevent brute force attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-endpoint rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Input Validation & Sanitization

- **Comprehensive Validation**: All user inputs are validated using Pydantic schemas
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: All database queries use parameterized statements
- **XSS Prevention**: Input sanitization and output encoding
- **File Upload Security**: Restricted file types and size limits
- **Email Validation**: Proper email format validation
- **Password Policy**: Strong password requirements with complexity checks

### Security Headers

- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enables XSS filtering
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS in production
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Restricts resource loading
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information

### Logging & Monitoring

- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs for better analysis
- **Security Event Logging**: Authentication attempts, failures, and violations
- **Request Logging**: HTTP request logging with timing and status codes
- **Audit Trail**: Data access and modification logging

### Error Handling

- **Information Disclosure Prevention**: Generic error messages in production
- **Structured Error Responses**: Consistent error format for clients
- **Security Violation Logging**: All security events are logged

## Security Best Practices

### Development

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Use strong, unique SECRET_KEY in production
   - Enable security headers in production
   - Configure CORS origins properly
   - Use secure cookie settings

2. **Code Security**
   - Always validate user inputs
   - Use parameterized database queries
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Follow the principle of least privilege

3. **Dependencies**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Use security scanning tools (bandit, safety)
   - Pin dependency versions
   - Review dependency licenses

### Deployment

1. **Production Configuration**
   - Set `APP_ENV=prod`
   - Use strong SECRET_KEY (minimum 32 characters)
   - Enable HTTPS/TLS
   - Configure proper CORS origins
   - Enable security headers

2. **Database Security**
   - Use encrypted database connections
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Set query timeouts
   - Regular database backups

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Use reverse proxy (nginx/Apache)
   - Enable firewall rules
   - Regular security updates
   - Monitor system logs

## Security Checklist

### Pre-deployment

- [ ] SECRET_KEY is set and strong (32+ characters)
- [ ] Environment is set to production
- [ ] CORS origins are properly configured
- [ ] Security headers are enabled
- [ ] HTTPS is configured
- [ ] Database connections are encrypted
- [ ] Rate limiting is enabled
- [ ] Logging is configured
- [ ] Dependencies are updated
- [ ] Security tests pass

### Post-deployment

- [ ] Monitor security logs
- [ ] Regular security scans
- [ ] Update dependencies regularly
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious activity
- [ ] Backup data regularly
- [ ] Test security features

## Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting Process

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue or pull request
2. **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly
3. Email security details to: security@yourdomain.com
4. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Timeline**: Within 30 days (depending on severity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed (coordinated disclosure)

### Vulnerability Severity

- **Critical**: Remote code execution, authentication bypass
- **High**: Privilege escalation, data exposure
- **Medium**: Information disclosure, denial of service
- **Low**: Minor security issues, best practice violations

## Security Tools

### Static Analysis

```bash
# Install security tools
pip install bandit safety

# Run security scans
bandit -r app/
safety check
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run security tests
pytest tests/test_security.py
pytest tests/test_api_security.py
```

### Monitoring

- Monitor application logs for security events
- Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts
- Monitor rate limiting violations
- Track suspicious IP addresses

## Security Updates

### Regular Updates

- **Dependencies**: Monthly security updates
- **Security Tools**: Quarterly updates
